# pvbrowser_test
pvbrowser SCADA integration with MODBUS tcp data acquisition

this is just a simple testbed for trying out PvBrowser capabilities ( http://pvbrowser.de/pvbrowser/index.php )

in this sample program there is a form with a pair of button and a label that updates itself with the value from a remote MODBUS PLC.

TODO: pushing the buttons activates remote coil "boolean flags" in the PLC
